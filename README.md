Find a dormitory with the help of machine learning from divar.ir in three steps:

 - get and parse details .
 - filter and add them to databse .
 - ask your city and how much money do you have? .
 - use machine learning to find a suitable dormitory for you .
 
## Tech

KhabgahYar uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [scikit-learn] - a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.
* [Beautiful Soup] - a Python package for parsing HTML and XML documents .
* [Requests] - the only Non-GMO HTTP library for Python!
* [mysql] - MySQL is an open source relational database management system (RDBMS).

And of course KhabgahYar itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/imansdn/khabgahYar)
 on GitHub.

## Information Resources

KhabgahYar use [Divar](https://www.divar.ir)(a classified ads platform in Iran with more than 13 million active Installations in the year )
## Briefly about Sk-learn
    x = [(input1,input2,...)]
    y = [(output1)]
    clf = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()
    clf.fit(x, y)
    answer = clf.predict([[new_input1, new_input2,...]])
