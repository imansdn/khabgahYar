 ### Tech

KhabgahYar uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [scikit-learn] - a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.
* [Beautiful Soup] - a Python package for parsing HTML and XML documents .
* [Requests] - the only Non-GMO HTTP library for Python!
* [mysql] - MySQL is an open source relational database management system (RDBMS).

And of course KhabgahYar itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/imansdn/khabgahYar)
 on GitHub.
